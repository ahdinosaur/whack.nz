# Imagine a Wellington Hackspace!

![An AI-generated sketch of a Hackspace](/hackspace.jpg)

A space where anyone can come to learn, make, or just hang out.

A space with access to 3d printers, sewing machines, laser cutters, CNC machines, soldering stations, and more.

A space to create community through self-guided learning, sharing, and problem solving.

This space does not exist yet, but you can help us make this a reality.
