# "Wackerspace"

Imagine a Wellington Hackerspace!

A space where anyone can come to learn, make, or just hang out.

A space with access to 3d printers, a laser cutter, sewing machines, CNC machines, soldering stations, and more.

A space to create community through self-guided learning, sharing, and problem solving.

This space does not exist yet, but you can help us make this a reality.

> Hacking is about making things, creating technology and solving problems with innovative solutions. Hackerspaces facilitate hacking through providing a community, a workshop and tools.
