# "Wackerspace"

Imagine a Wellington hackerspace!

![An AI-generated sketch of a Makerspace](/makerspace-sketch.jpg)

A space where anyone can come to learn, make, or just hang out.

A space with access to 3d printers, sewing machines, a laser cutter, CNC machines, soldering stations, and more.

A space to create community through self-guided learning, sharing, and problem solving.

This space does not exist yet, but you can help us make this a reality.
