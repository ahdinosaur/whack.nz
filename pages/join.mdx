# Join the "Wellington Hackspace"

The "Wellington Hackspace" is only imaginary, so we need potential members to express their interest.

Membership will provide full access to the space 24/7.

As for rates, membership will cost $30 per week.

(With a pay-what-you-can-afford rate to those who volunteer hours to the space.)

We're in contact with [11 Hopper Street](https://www.hopper.nz/) who supports community, the opportunity is here.

So let's make this happen!

<form
  action="https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/whack"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.com/whack', 'popupwindow')"
  className="embeddable-buttondown-form mt-5"
>
  <label className="form-control w-full max-w-xs">
    <div className="label">
      <span className="label-text">What is your email?</span>
    </div>
    <input type="email" name="email" id="bd-email" placeholder="charlie@example.com" className="input input-bordered w-full max-w-xs" />
  </label>

  <input type="submit" value="Express your interest" className="btn btn-primary ml-1 mt-5" />
</form>

Once there's enough interest, [Mikey](https://mikey.nz) will host an in-person event to get things moving, listen to your inbox.
