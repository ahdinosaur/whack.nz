# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General questions

### What is a Hackspace?

A Hackspace (or Hackerspace) is a member-led place where people can meet and work on creative, technical, or artistic projects using shared tools and resources.

Hackspaces are run by **"do-ocracy"**, which means that the people who take action and do things are the ones who make decisions.

Hackspaces are part of an international movement, with spaces like this all over the world. You can learn more at [wiki.hackerspaces.org](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackerspaces).

### Is this like a Makerspace?

Yes, but not exactly.

A **Makerspace** is also a place where people make things, share knowledge, and work together.

But Makerspaces can be set up in different ways depending on who runs them.

We’re similar to [Hackland](https://hackland.nz/) in Auckland:

- Our space is run by members, in a **bottom-up** way. Members who get involved help make decisions.
- We’re a legally recognized group (called an incorporated society).
- Members rent and manage the space together, and have **24/7 access**.
- There’s no staff managing the space — members are expected to **clean up** and **help maintain the tools**.

Many other Makerspaces are sponsored by institutions. These spaces are usually managed **top-down**, which means they have staff in charge.

For example, in Wellington:

- **[Tūhura HIVE Makerspace in Johnsonville](https://www.wcl.govt.nz/services/technology/makerspace/)** is run by the **library**.
- **[Fab Lab Wgtn](https://www.fablabwgtn.co.nz/)** is run by a **university**.

### Do I need to be a hacker or have specific skills to join?

No! The space is open to everyone, whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced maker. You don’t need to be technical or have specific skills—there are plenty of ways to get involved and learn.

### Why should I join a hackerspace instead of working from home?

Joining a hackerspace gives you access to tools and equipment that may be expensive or difficult to have at home. It’s also a great way to connect with others, share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn new skills.

## Membership & Participation

### Do I need to be a member to use the space?

You don’t need to be a member to attend public events or workshops, but membership gives you full access to the space, tools, and resources. Members also get a say in how the space is run.

### How much does membership cost, and what are the benefits?

Membership costs $30 per week and includes unlimited access to the space, tools, and discounts on workshops and events. Your fees also help support the space by covering rent, maintenance, and new equipment.

### That's too expensive! How else can I become a member?

With the cost of living crisis, we know not everyone can afford to pay the standard membership rate.

There's a pay-what-you-can-afford membership rate for those who volunteer 1 hour per week.

## Facilities & Tools

### What tools and equipment are available?

We have a variety of tools, including 3D printers, sewing machines, laser cutters, woodworking tools, electronics stations, and more.

### Is training available for the tools?

Members may offer training sessions for tools that require special knowledge.

Some equipment may require certification before use for safety reasons.

### When can I come to the space?
### What are the hours of operation, and do members have 24/7 access?

Members have 24/7 access to the space. Non-members can visit during public workshops and open events.

## Safety & Rules

### How is safety managed in the space?

We have safety protocols for using tools, and training is required for more complex or dangerous equipment. We also expect members to keep the space clean and organized for everyone's safety.

Yes, members can store ongoing projects at the space, but storage is limited and subject to availability.

## Practicalities

## Funding & Sustainability

### How is the hackerspace funded?

The space is funded primarily through membership fees, donations, and occasional sponsorships. All the money goes toward keeping the space open, maintaining tools, and buying new equipment.
